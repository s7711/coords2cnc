# coords2cnc.py

This is a set of python functions to generate gcode files for a 3-axis cnc machine from geometry that you define. So far there I have only done a couple of functions: cut the outline of a polygon and drill a hole.

This code has mainly been generated by copilot, as part of my experiments to see what copilot can achieve: it is fair to say that copilot needs a lot of help and makes plenty of mistakes. I've not tested everything so **check everything yourself**. My utility **nc2image2** can be used to view the output so you don't have to check using some scrap wood on a real cnc machine.

Rather than create yet another file format to define the geometry, you have to modify the python directly. Look at the function calls at the bottom of the code.

To cut a polygon make a list of tuples (x,y) for the points of the polygon. The function will cut on the right of your polygon, which allows you to cut outside (clockwise polygons viewed from above) or inside (anti-clockwise polygons). The function cuts the polygon twice: one rough cut and then one final cut. Rather than have a long parameter list, I have made a dictionary for the configuration.

To drill holes use the drill_hole function and pass a list of tuples (x,y) for the position of the holes. The drill function assumes you have a mill bit (not a drill bit) and can make holes that are larger than the diameter of the mill bit.

As always, do not trust this software. Check everything yourself. Good luck, enjoy.
